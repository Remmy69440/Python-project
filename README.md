# DATA ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON

Welcome to the world of data analytics with Python! In this file, you will find a collection of projects and resources that showcase the power and versatility of Python in data analysis.

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in data analysis. It has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform complex data analysis tasks, such as data mining, data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

In this file, you will find examples of Python code that demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis using Python. One notable project is "CRIME," which focuses on analyzing the rate of crime in the United States. This Python project shows and analyzes how crime occurred from 2015 to 2018, providing insights into crime trends over this period.

These projects showcase my ability to extract insights from data and present them in a clear and visually appealing way. I hope you find this repository to be informative and engaging. I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience further. Thank you for visiting my repository and happy data analyzing with Python!
